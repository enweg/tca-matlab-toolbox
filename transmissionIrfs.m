function effects = transmissionIrfs(from, irfs, irfsOrtho, varAnd, varNot, multiplier)
    % `transmissionIrfs` Compute the transmission effect using the IRF method.
    %
    %   `effects = transmissionIrfs(from, irfs, irfsOrtho, varAnd, varNot, multiplier)` 
    %   calculates the transmission effect using impulse response functions (IRFs).
    %
    %   Arguments:
    %   - `from` (integer): Index of the shock.
    %   - `irfs` (matrix): Structural impulse responses (only the one of the `from`
    %     shock is needed). Must be a matrix which can be obtained from `toTransmissionIrfs`.
    %   - `irfsOrtho` (matrix): Cholesky IRFs that must use the ordering defined
    %     in the transmission matrix. Must be a matrix which can be obtained from `toTransmissionIrfs`.
    %   - `varAnd` (vector of integers): Indices of variables that must be included 
    %     (AND conditions). Can be obtained from `getVarNumsAndMultiplier`.
    %   - `varNot` (vector of integers): Indices of variables that must be excluded 
    %     (NOT conditions). Can be obtained from `getVarNumsAndMultiplier`.
    %   - `multiplier` (number): Multiplier associated with each term. Can be 
    %     obtained from `getVarNumsAndMultiplier`.
    %
    %   ## Returns
    %   - `effects` (vector): A vector where entry `i` corresponds to the transmission 
    %     effect on variable `x_i`. 
    %
    %   ## Example
    %   ```
    %   k = 6;
    %   h = 3;
    %   s = "x1";
    %   cond = makeCondition(s);
    %
    %   irfs = randn(k, k, h+1);
    %   irfsOrtho = randn(k, k, h+1);
    %
    %   irfs = toTransmissionIrfs(irfs);
    %   irfsOrtho = toTransmissionIrfs(irfsOrtho);
    %
    %   [varAnd, varNot, multiplier] = getVarNumsAndMultiplier(cond);
    %   effect = transmissionIrfs(1, irfs, irfsOrtho, varAnd{1}, varNot{1}, multiplier);
    %   ```
