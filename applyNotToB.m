function [BTilde, OmegaTilde] = applyNotToB(B, Omega, from, var)
    % applyNotToB Manipulate B and Omega to ensure var lies on no paths.
    %
    %   applyNotToB(B, Omega, from, var) modifies the matrices B and Omega such that 
    %   the variable indexed by var is absent from all paths. This is achieved by:
    %   - Zeroing out the edge from the shock (indexed by from) to var.
    %   - Zeroing out all edges from variables ordered before var to var.
    %
    %   Arguments:
    %   - B (matrix): Part of the system's representation g.
    %   - Omega (matrix): Part of the system's representation g.
    %   - from (integer): The shock index.
    %   - var (integer): The variable index that cannot lie on any paths.
    %
    %   Notes:
    %   - This function is intended for internal use only.
