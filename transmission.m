function effects = transmission(from, arr1, arr2, q, method, order)
    % `transmission` Compute the transmission effect given a transmission condition.
    %
    %   `effects = transmission(from, arr1, arr2, q, method)` calculates the 
    %   transmission effect for a given transmission condition `q` using either 
    %   the `BOmega` method or the `irf` method. If `BOmega` is used, then 
    %   transmission effects will be calculated using the systems form 
    %   $x = Bx + \Omega\varepsilon$
    %
    %   ## Arguments
    %   - `from` (integer): Index of the shock.
    %   - `arr1` (matrix): 
    %       - If `method = "BOmega"`, this must be `B` from the systems form.
    %       - If `method = "irf"`, this must be structural `irfs` (technically
    %         only those of the shock that is being investigates (`from`)). 
    %         Has to be a IRF matrix. See `toTransmissionIrfs` for more information.
    %   - `arr2` (matrix): 
    %       - If `method = "BOmega"`, this must be `Omega` from the systems form.
    %       - If `method = "irf"`, this must be `irfsOrtho` (Cholesky IRFs) following 
    %         the ordering of the transmission matrix.
    %   - `q` (Q): A transmission condition. See also `Q`.
    %   - `method` (string): Specifies the calculation method:
    %       - `"BOmega"` uses the systems form.
    %       - `"irf"` uses only IRFs and can thus be used with local projections.
    %   - `order` (vector, optional): variable ordering as defined by the transmission matrix.
    %
    %   ## Returns:
    %   - `effects` (vector): A vector where entry `i` corresponds to the transmission 
    %     effect on variable `x_i`. If `x_k` is the variable in the transmission 
    %     condition with the highest index, all entries in the returned vector with 
    %     index less than `k` are `NaN`, since interpretation of those results is nonsensical.
    %
    %   ## Example:
    %   ```
    %   k = 6;
    %   h = 3;
    %   s = "(x1 | x2) & !x3";
    %   cond = makeCondition(s);
    %
    %   B = randn(k*(h+1), k*(h+1));
    %   Omega = randn(k*(h+1), k*(h+1));
    %
    %   effect = transmission(1, B, Omega, cond, "BOmega");
    %
    %   irfs = randn(k, k, h+1);
    %   irfsOrtho = randn(k, k, h+1);
    %
    %   irfs = toTransmissionIrfs(irfs);
    %   irfsOrtho = toTransmissionIrfs(irfsOrtho);
    %
    %   effect = transmission(1, irfs, irfsOrtho, cond, "irf");
    %   ```
    %
    %   ## Notes:
    %   - If `method = "BOmega"`, the function applies `transmissionBOmega`.
    %   - If `method = "irf"`, the function applies `transmissionIrfs`.
    %   - If `order` is provided, the returned effects will be a 3D array 
    %     of dimension (nVariables, 1, horizons) where the variables are in the 
    %     original ordering (before applying the transmission matrix).
    %   - If `order` is not provided, the returned effects will be a (nVariable*horizons, 1)
    %     dimensional vector following the ordering after applying the transmission 
    %     matrix. This is similar to the matrix obtained via $(I - B)^{-1}\Omega$
    %     using the matrices from the systems form.
